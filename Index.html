	<h2>An Introduction</h2>
 	<p>The Eurasian magpie or common magpie (<i>Pica pica</i>) is a resident breeding bird throughout Europe, much of Asia and northwest Africa. It is one of several birds in the crow family designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of "monochrome" magpies. In Europe, "magpie" is used by English speakers as a synonym for the European magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (<i>Cyanopica cooki</i>), which is limited to the Iberian peninsula.</p>
    
 	<p>The Eurasian magpie is one of the most <a href="Intelligence.html">intelligent</a> birds, and it is believed to be one of the most intelligent of all non-human animals. The expansion of its nidopallium is approximately the same in its relative size as the brain of chimpanzees, orangutans and humans.</p>
